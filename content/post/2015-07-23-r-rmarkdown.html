<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Voter interest and engagement is crucial to the function of democracy. In this paper, we explore the results of the 2019 Canadian Election Study to gain insight to the determinants of voter interest in the 2019 election cycle. We find that the average stated interest in this election increased with age and was generally lower amongst young (potentially first-time) voters. These results may have strong implications for future voter engagement strategies and could act as indicators for future trends in the Canadian political landscape.</p>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>The dataset in use for this project is the results of the online 2019 Canadian Election Study (CES). The CES is a survey of the Canadian population coinciding with each Canadian election year. It provides data on a variety of political and social topics, such as views of democracy, political interest, opinions of current leaders and parties, and topics of interest in the corresponding election cycle. In 2019, the CES was conducted via online and phone-based surveys. In this paper we will examine the data resulting from the online CES, specifically those</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This data displays a clear downward trend in stated interest in the 2019 election based on age, with the average response of the youngest respondents approximately 1.5 points lower than that of respondents born around 1940.</p>
</div>
<div id="weaknesses-and-future-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Weaknesses and Future Work</h1>
<p>This analysis of the CES only includes the online survey results and does not include the phone survey results. It is possible that the distribution in the age of respondents would be impacted by the responses from the phone survey, and this may influence the strength of the trend in the data. There were also limited respondents to the online survey born between 1920 and 1940 which likely contributes to the high variance and lack of distinct pattern seen in the data for this age group. There were relatively fewer respondents born after 1990 compared to those born between 1950 and 1990. This may indicate a lack of engagement that matches the lower interest level observed in this age group, or may indicate a need to conduct further outreach to this age group in order to improve response rates for the next CES.</p>
<p>In future, it may be worth examining the trends in age and interest across all available years of the CES to determine whether young voters within each election cycle tend to be less engaged, if there emerge any generational trends in interest levels, or if there exists any seasonality in interest levels within age groups.</p>
